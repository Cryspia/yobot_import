# Yobot Import

A simple implementation to import form JSON output of [PCR yobot server](https://github.com/yuudi/yobot) to the sqlite3 database.
This project can be used when you do not have access to a server but want to copy the data, or you want to do a routine backup using only the web JSON output.
